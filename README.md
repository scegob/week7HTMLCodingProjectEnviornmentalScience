# week7HTMLCodingProjectEnviornmentalScience

https://scegob.github.io/week7HTMLCodingProjectEnviornmentalScience/

For week 7 our goal was to make a basic HTML website. The css will be added during week 8. Our assignment required a minimum of 

1.	Create a website using only HTML. The website can be anything you like (within school guidelines) as long as it meets the following criteria â€“ website must contain:
a.	At least 3 pages
b.	Links to navigate between all pages present on each page
c.	A list
d.	3 images
e.	2 different size headers
f.	A table
g.	A form

I decided to simulate freelancing by building a website for my enviornmental science professor to use as a resource for students to prep for the midterm and in the future I will add more so that students can prepare for the final.
This project has taught me alot about the inner workings of a website and building projects in the real world and hopefully I can build more projects in the future for clients.

A piece of code that I am proud of is the table since it took me a while to figure out what kind of data I would like to show case.

<table>

              <th>Place</th>
              <th>Per capita ecological footprint (hectares per person)</th>
              <th>Per capita biological capacity (hectares per person)</th>
              <th>Ecological credit (+) or Deficit (-) (hectares per person)</th>
